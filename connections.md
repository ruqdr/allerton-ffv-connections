# Isaac Allerton and the First Families of Virginia

## Introduction
This document traces the documented genealogical and historical links between Isaac Allerton (c. 1586–1659) and the leading families of colonial Virginia, collectively known as the First Families of Virginia (FFVs). The connections are drawn from wills, land deeds, marriage records, and other primary sources.

## Allerton's Virginia Descendants
Isaac Allerton Sr. had several children who settled in Virginia, most notably his son **Isaac Allerton Jr. (c. 1630–1702)**. Isaac Jr. moved to Virginia around the mid‑17th century, became a merchant and planter, and served as a Burgess and Justice in Northumberland and Westmoreland Counties. He married twice:

1. **Elizabeth (unknown)** – married about 1652. Children:
   * Elizabeth Allerton (b. 1653) – married Thomas Eyres.
   * Isaac Allerton III (b. 1655) – died without issue.

2. **Elizabeth Willoughby** – married after September 1662. Children:
   * Willoughby Allerton (c. 1664) – no known marriage.
   * Frances Allerton (c. 1669) – married John Travers of the Travers family.
   * **Sarah Allerton (c. 1670) – married Richard Lee II (the Scholar)**.

### Key Connection: Allerton‑Lee Marriage
The marriage of **Sarah Allerton** to **Richard Lee II** (son of Richard Lee I, founder of the Lee dynasty in Virginia) creates a direct genealogical link between the Allerton Pilgrim line and the Lee family, one of the most prominent FFVs. Through this union, descendants of Isaac Allerton became part of the Virginia gentry and intermarried with other leading families.
