# Allerton-FFV Connections Project

## Purpose
This project documents the verifiable genealogical and historical connections between Isaac Allerton (c. 1586–1659) and the prominent First Families of Virginia (FFVs). The families of particular interest include Bland, Braxton, Byrd, Carter, Chapman, Corbin, Fitzhugh, Harrison, Lee, Ludwell, Nelson, Randolph, Washington, and Wormley.

## Isaac Allerton: The Wayward Pilgrim
Isaac Allerton was a Pilgrim who arrived in Plymouth aboard the *Mayflower* in 1620. After several years in New England, he moved to Virginia, where he became a successful merchant and planter. His descendants intermarried with many of Virginia's leading families, forming a key link between the early New England and Virginia gentry.

## Project Structure
The central document for this research is [`connections.md`](./connections.md), which will be updated as connections are verified through historical records.

## How to Contribute
This repository simulates a collaborative research workflow using GitHub's issue tracking, branching, and pull‑request review system. Research questions are tracked as issues, proposed findings are developed in feature branches, and changes are reviewed via pull requests before being merged into the main historical record.
